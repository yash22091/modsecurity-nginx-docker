# ModSecurity NGINX WAF - Containerized Open Source Web Application Firewall

## Overview

This project packages **ModSecurity v3**, **OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS)**, and **NGINX** into a lightweight, secure, and flexible **containerized Web Application Firewall** (WAF). It supports both **standalone deployment** and **reverse proxy mode** in front of backend apps like **Node.js**, **Django**, **Flask**, or **Apache** servers.

# How to Build a Containerized Open Source WAF with ModSecurity + NGINX

## Introduction: Why a WAF is Critical in the Modern Web

Every modern web application is exposed to risks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), automated scanners, and more. While frameworks offer built-in defenses, these are often not enough, especially when your app is public-facing.

A Web Application Firewall (WAF) becomes a gatekeeper that inspects every HTTP request, filters malicious payloads, and logs suspicious behavior before it hits your backend.

* **ModSecurity v3** (the OWASP open-source WAF engine)
* **NGINX** (serving as reverse proxy with WAF integration)
* **OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS)** (predefined rules for blocking common attack patterns)
* **Docker + Docker Compose** (for reproducible, scalable deployments)


This stack is ideal for:

* Protecting APIs or web apps in Kubernetes
* Acting as a reverse proxy for legacy applications
* Hosting secure staging environments

---

###  Runtime Best Practices

* `server_tokens off` to hide NGINX version
* Strong TLS setup with fallback redirects
* Rate limiting configured with `limit_req_zone`
* Secure HTTP headers added (CSP, X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy)
* HTTPS-only entrypoint (redirect from HTTP handled in config)
* TLS cert auto-generation is conditional (skips if certs already present)
* Entrypoint triggers inotify-based watcher for hot reloads without restarting container
* Optional recommendation to run as non-root user in hardened production environments

### nginx.conf Usage Strategy

* `modsec-data/nginx.conf`: Used by default for standalone WAF.
* `modsec-data/nginx.conf.reverse.proxy`: Used when reverse proxying to a backend. **Make sure to update proxy settings inside it as per your app ports and routes.**

You can mount either in `docker-compose.yml` or `docker-compose.override.yml`.

## Makefile Shortcuts for Quick Deployment

The repository comes with a ready-to-use `Makefile` to help manage TLS certs, build the WAF, update rules, and deploy quickly.

## ModSecurity Custom Rules (Example)

```apache
# Block a specific parameter
SecRule ARGS:testparam "@streq test" "id:10001,phase:2,deny,log,status:403,msg:'Test parameter blocked'"

# Block curl User-Agent
SecRule REQUEST_HEADERS:User-Agent "@contains curl" "id:10002,phase:1,deny,log,status:403,msg:'Curl blocked'"

# Basic SQLi pattern
SecRule ARGS "@rx (?i)(union(.*?)select|select.+from)" "id:10003,phase:2,deny,log,status:403,msg:'SQLi blocked'"
```

---

## ⇄️ Dynamic Rule Reload (Watcher)

The `watcher.sh` script watches `custom-rules.conf` and reloads NGINX:

```bash
make watch
```

No container restart is needed. For this to work:

* Mount rules in `docker-compose.yml`
* Ensure `modsecurity_rules_file` in `modsecurity.conf` includes them

## Troubleshooting Guide

| Problem                    | Solution                                                               |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ssl` directive fails      | Rebuild NGINX with `--with-http_ssl_module`                            |
| Cannot load `.data` files  | Ensure CRS `.data` files are mounted                                   |
| ModSecurity not triggering | Ensure `SecRuleEngine On` and rule IDs are unique                      |
| Rule edits not applied     | Use `make watch` or restart container                                  |
| HTTPS error                | Ensure valid `server.crt` and `server.key` exist                       |
| WAF config not picked      | Double check which nginx.conf is mounted (standalone vs reverse proxy) |

## Security Best Practices Implemented

* `server_tokens off` to hide version info
* HTTPS enforced with redirect from HTTP
* Rate limiting per IP (10r/s)
* Secure headers: `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`
* TLS certificate auto-generation via `cert-gen.sh`
* Runtime user separation (optional)
* Auto reload of rules via watcher
